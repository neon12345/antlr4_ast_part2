# About  

This is a proof-of-concept implementation to convert an antlr4 parse tree automatically into an AST. 

It is the second of two projects and Linux C++ only.
  
The swift5 grammar for the Swift language is used as a starting point to develop the conversion algorithm. It is possible to generalize it later and have the first project included into antlr.

## How it works  

This project is a visitor program for the target language with the generated files from the first project (AstBuilder.h and AstBuilder.cpp).

The first project is a visitor program using the antlr4 grammar for grammars (ANTLRv4Parser.g4). A conversion algorithm identifies main rules for AST node classes and propagates the needed data fields from the children. It then generates visitor files for the target grammar to create an AST form source files of the target language.  
   
## Usage
  
Call the program with the one arguments: target_file.swift

## Output
  
The output of the program can vary during development. The final output should be the printed source generated by walking the AST.
